## Contributions
Julia was responsible for creating the post tweet and home timeline retreival for strategy 2 and adding her ideas to the analysis report. Ceara was responsible for home timeline retreival using strategy 2, writing the analysis report, and reporting results. We both looked over each other's code and made optimizations to our own and each other's functions when possible.
